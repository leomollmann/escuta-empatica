- I can't believe what happened to me yesterday, my car broke down on the highway and I had to wait hours for a tow truck.
- Oh no, that sounds like a nightmare. Are you okay now?
- Yeah, thankfully I'm fine but it was definitely a stressful situation.
- Well, at least you weren't hurt. It's always a scary experience when your car breaks down.
- Definitely. Have you ever had a similar experience?
- Thankfully not on the highway, but I have had my fair share of car troubles in the past.
- It's always unexpected and inconvenient when it happens.
- For sure, but it's just a part of life I guess. We have to deal with these things as they come.
- That's true. Life throws us curveballs sometimes, we just have to roll with the punches.
- Exactly. It's all about staying positive and finding a solution to whatever comes our way.
- That's a good attitude to have. Well, I'm glad you're okay now after your car troubles.
- Thank you, I appreciate it. It's nice to have friends who are there for support during tough times.
- Of course, that's what friends are for. I'm always here for you if you need anything.
- Thanks, I'm lucky to have you as a friend. Let's grab a coffee sometime soon to catch up.
- That sounds like a plan. Let's set a date, I could use some good company and caffeine.
- Perfect, looking forward to it. Have a good day!
- You too, take care!
