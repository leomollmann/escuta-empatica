- Yesterday I came home and the sink was once again full of dirty dishes. The guy doesn't care. I've already asked him to wash it as he cooks so it doesn't accumulate, but it's no use! I can not take it anymore.
- I'm listening to you and realizing that there's anger, frustration there, does that make sense?
- Yes, and tiredness as well.
- And perhaps these feelings are present because you need reciprocity and respect.
- That's it, I really need it. Of consideration as well.
