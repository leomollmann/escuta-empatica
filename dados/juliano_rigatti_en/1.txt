- I don't know what to do. I was waiting to get out of my doctoral scholarship at the university, but they're dragging me around and I don't think I can get out. A month ago I had a meeting, they said that they really liked my line of research and that they didn't let me down. Yesterday, everything changed. They want me to pay, but I can't afford it. After years of dedication as a teacher, I was counting on that money. It would be very important for my income. I don't even know what to think.
- I was listening to you and I think I identified some feelings there. Maybe sadness, frustration, disappointment... Could it be?
- It could be, yes. There are certainly three. Disappointment, anxiety too.
- Hmm. Maybe you're also afraid of running out of income?
- Yes true. He's afraid too. I didn't realize it and it could be influenced in my reactivity towards them.
- And I imagine that the fear comes because you have a strong need for material security. It makes sense?
- Total. Good to find that out, I hadn't even realized it.
- And the disappointment I think came because you need greater reciprocity and attention to the years of dedication and it seems that this is not being met...
- Yes, in several situations where the university needed me, I was there. Now that I need it, and it's fair, they don't help me.
- Yes, I understand.
