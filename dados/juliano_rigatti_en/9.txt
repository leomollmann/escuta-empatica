- I can’t concentrate on my studies. Every five minutes, I pick up my cell phone to see if there's anything new. 
- I notice that you are apprehensive about not being able to study and disappointed with your lack of focus. And that?
- Yes, that way I won’t pass the year. And it's true, they're disappointed in me too.
- If you could be less distracted, would that meet your desire for efficiency and safety? 
- That would help a lot, yes.
