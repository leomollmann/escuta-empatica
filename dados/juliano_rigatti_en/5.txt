- Every time I try to talk to my sister about our travel plans, she changes the subject. I feel like she's not taking it seriously. 
- It sounds like you are feeling alone and worried about her commitment, am I right? 
- Yes, that's it. I want her to understand that she is important to me and that I need company in this. 
- Maybe deep down, you are looking for her cooperation so that you feel connected in this project together. 
- Exactly, I want to feel like weâ€™re on the same page.
