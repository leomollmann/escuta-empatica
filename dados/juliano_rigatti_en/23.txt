- I'm feeling pressured when deciding to choose a career. 
- Behind the "pressure" I notice that there is a feeling of loneliness and lack of company and even more understanding of the options.

- Maybe you are looking for space and autonomy to make the right choice for you.
- Yes, I need that: space and autonomy.
