- I recently learned that my best friend has been spreading rumors about me behind my back.
- Oh no, that must be really hurtful to hear.
- It is, I never expected someone I trusted so much to betray me like this.
- It sounds like you're feeling a mix of betrayal, sadness, and disappointment.
- That's exactly how I feel. I trusted them completely.
- It's natural to feel that way when someone you care about betrays your trust.
- I just feel so lost and unsure of who to trust now.
- It's important to remember that this situation says more about them than it does about you.
- You're right, it's not a reflection of my worth as a person.
- Absolutely. It's important to surround yourself with genuine and trustworthy people.
- I just wish I could have seen this coming sooner.
- It's okay to feel that way, but remember that you're not responsible for someone else's actions.
- Thank you for reminding me of that. It helps to talk about it.
- I'm here to support you through this tough situation.
- I appreciate your support. It means a lot to me.
- Just remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and honesty.
- Thank you, I'll try to keep that in mind moving forward.
