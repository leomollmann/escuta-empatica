- I just found out that my best friend is moving away and I feel so lost without her.
- It seems like you're feeling a sense of loneliness and abandonment with her leaving. Am I understanding you correctly?
- Yes, exactly. She's been my rock for so long, and I don't know what I'll do without her.
- It sounds like her presence has been really important to you and her absence is leaving a void.
- Precisely. It's like a big part of my life is suddenly missing.
- It must be really tough to imagine not having her around anymore.
- It is. I feel like I'm losing a piece of myself.
- Have you talked to your friend about how you're feeling?
- I have, but she's excited about her new adventure and it seems like she's already moving on.
- It must be hard when it feels like she's already moved on while you're still processing her leaving.
- Yes, exactly. It's like our friendship meant more to me than it did to her.
- It's understandable to feel hurt and confused by the situation.
- Thank you for understanding. It helps to have someone listen while I'm going through this.
- I'm here for you and I'll support you through this transition in any way I can.
- Thank you. Your support means the world to me during this difficult time.
