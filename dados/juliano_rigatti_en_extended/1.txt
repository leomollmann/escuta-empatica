- I don't know what to do. I was waiting to get out of my doctoral scholarship at the university, but they're dragging me around and I don't think I can get out. A month ago I had a meeting, they said that they really liked my line of research and that they didn't let me down. Yesterday, everything changed. They want me to pay, but I can't afford it. After years of dedication as a teacher, I was counting on that money. It would be very important for my income. I don't even know what to think.
- I was listening to you and I think I identified some feelings there. Maybe sadness, frustration, disappointment... Could it be?
- It could be, yes. There are certainly three. Disappointment, anxiety too.
- Hmm. Maybe you're also afraid of running out of income?
- Yes true. He's afraid too. I didn't realize it and it could be influenced in my reactivity towards them.
- And I imagine that the fear comes because you have a strong need for material security. It makes sense?
- Total. Good to find that out, I hadn't even realized it.
- And the disappointment I think came because you need greater reciprocity and attention to the years of dedication and it seems that this is not being met...
- Yes, in several situations where the university needed me, I was there. Now that I need it, and it's fair, they don't help me.
- Yes, I understand.
- It's understandable that you feel let down by the university after all the effort you've put in.
- Yes, it's just frustrating to feel like my hard work isn't being recognized.
- I can see how that would be tough to deal with.
- It really is. I feel like my future is uncertain now.
- That uncertainty must be causing a lot of stress for you.
- It definitely is. I feel like I can't plan ahead anymore.
- It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed in this situation.
- Thank you for understanding. It helps to talk about it with someone who gets it.
- I'm here to listen and support you through this difficult time.
- I appreciate that. It means a lot to me.
- Just remember, it's okay to feel how you're feeling right now.
- Thank you. I'll try to remind myself of that.
