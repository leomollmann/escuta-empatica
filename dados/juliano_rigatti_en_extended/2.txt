- Yesterday I came home and the sink was once again full of dirty dishes. The guy doesn't care. I've already asked him to wash it as he cooks so it doesn't accumulate, but it's no use! I can not take it anymore.
- I'm listening to you and realizing that there's anger, frustration there, does that make sense?
- Yes, and tiredness as well.
- And perhaps these feelings are present because you need reciprocity and respect.
- That's it, I really need it. Of consideration as well.
- It sounds like you've been feeling overwhelmed by the situation.
- Yes, exactly. I feel like I'm the only one taking care of things in the house.
- It must be exhausting to constantly feel like you're carrying all the responsibility.
- It really is. I just wish he would listen and understand how I'm feeling.
- It sounds like you're seeking understanding and support from him.
- Yes, that's exactly it. I feel like I'm not being heard.
- It's important to feel heard and validated in your feelings.
- I just don't know how to get through to him and make him see my perspective.
- It sounds like communication is a big challenge in this situation.
- It really is. I feel like we're always talking past each other.
- Maybe it would help to have a calm and honest conversation about how you're feeling.
- I think you're right. I need to find a way to express myself clearly without getting too emotional.
- It's important to communicate your needs in a way that allows for understanding and resolution.
