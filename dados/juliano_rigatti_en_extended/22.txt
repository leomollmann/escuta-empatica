- I feel like my teenage son is moving away from me. 
- You seem to be worried about your connection and even his safety. And that? 
- Yes, I feel like I'm losing my son. 
- I also notice a need for clarity as to why this happened and how it could change.
- This is very important to me.
- I can imagine how difficult it must be for you to feel that distance growing.
- It's heartbreaking, really. I just want to understand what's going on.
- Have you tried talking to your son about how you're feeling?
- I have, but he just shuts down and doesn't want to talk.
- That must be so frustrating for you.
- It really is. I just want to know how to help him.
- Maybe he's going through a tough time and doesn't know how to express it.
- That could be it. I just wish he would open up to me.
