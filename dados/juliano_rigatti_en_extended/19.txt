- My partner and I have been arguing a lot lately. I'm frustrated. 
- You seem to be feeling worn out and need harmony. Am I interpreting correctly? 
- Not just harmony, more reciprocity on his part. 
- I understood. As if you wanted support to resolve this together. 
- Exactly, that would help us sort things out.
- It sounds like you're looking for more collaboration and understanding in your relationship.
- Yes, that's it. I feel like I'm the only one making an effort to make things work.
- It must be tough feeling like you're carrying the weight of the relationship on your shoulders.
- It is, it's exhausting.
- Have you talked to your partner about how you're feeling?
- I tried, but it seems like he's not really listening.
- It's important for both partners to feel heard and understood in a relationship.
- I know, but I don't know how to make him understand.
- Maybe setting aside some dedicated time to have an open and honest conversation could help.
- That's a good idea, I'll try that. Thank you for listening and giving me advice.
- Of course, I'm here to support you.
