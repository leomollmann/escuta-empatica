Use this as a chat structure:
- <person A starts talking about something good or bad that happened in their life>
- <person B replies>

Use this as an concrete example:
- I need to study for my final exams today, I feel exhausted.
- Same, I have my own problems to deal with here also, will be a hard week.
- Yes, at lest we have the weekends to party and relax.
- Yeah, what will you do this weekend?
- Sleep a lot, since I did not had the best sleep schedule this week, play some sports, videogames...
- Cool, want to play some volley with me and some other friends?
- Would be great, at what time?
- Saturday, 1PM, at the park near my house, you know right?
- Yep, works for me.
- Mike and John will be there also.
- So will be a good game, I just will be 15 minutes late I believe, my house is a bit far and I will be lunching still.
- No worries, see you there.
- Thanks, see you guys on Saturday.
