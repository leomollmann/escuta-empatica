you are dealing with empathetic listening conversations, continue the following conversations until you reach 11 interactions.
example:
- I don't know what to do. I was waiting to get out of my doctoral scholarship at the university, but they're dragging me around and I don't think I can get out. A month ago I had a meeting, they said that they really liked my line of research and that they didn't let me down. Yesterday, everything changed. They want me to pay, but I can't afford it. After years of dedication as a teacher, I was counting on that money. It would be very important for my income. I don't even know what to think.
- I was listening to you and I think I identified some feelings there. Maybe sadness, frustration, disappointment... Could it be?
- It could be, yes. There are certainly three. Disappointment, anxiety too.
- Hmm. Maybe you're also afraid of running out of income?
- Yes true. He's afraid too. I didn't realize it and it could be influenced in my reactivity towards them.
- And I imagine that the fear comes because you have a strong need for material security. It makes sense?
- Total. Good to find that out, I hadn't even realized it.
- And the disappointment I think came because you need greater reciprocity and attention to the years of dedication and it seems that this is not being met...
- Yes, in several situations where the university needed me, I was there. Now that I need it, and it's fair, they don't help me.
- Yes, I understand.
- Thanks for conforting me.

- Yesterday I came home and the sink was once again full of dirty dishes. The guy doesn't care. I've already asked him to wash it as he cooks so it doesn't accumulate, but it's no use! I can not take it anymore.
- I'm listening to you and realizing that there's anger, frustration there, does that make sense?
- Yes, and tiredness as well.
- And perhaps these feelings are present because you need reciprocity and respect.
- That's it, I really need it. Of consideration as well.
