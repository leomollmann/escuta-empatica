- I had a great time at the party last night, the music was amazing.
- I wish I could have gone, but I had to work late last night.
- That's a bummer, maybe next time you can join us.
- Definitely, I need a fun night out.
- We missed you on the dance floor, it was so much fun.
- I'm sure it was, I heard it was a blast.
- You should come to the next one, it's happening next Friday.
- I'll check my schedule, but I think I can make it.
- Awesome, it's going to be even better than last night.
- I can't wait, I need a night of dancing and fun.
- It's a date then, see you next Friday at the party.
- Sounds good, looking forward to it.
